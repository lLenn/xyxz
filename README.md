# Portfolio

These are a few examples of code that I have written during my years as a programmer.
This folder is used to provide future employers a glance of what kind of asset I can be to their company.
I've made a selection of best and/or latest code I have written.

## Greeni-shop

This code was written during my employment at Garden Machinery during 2010 - 2011.
It shows my appreciation for a well written code, form validation and my mastery of cURL.
